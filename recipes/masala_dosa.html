    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Masala dosa is a popular South Indian dish consisting of a crispy, thin crepe made from fermented rice and urad dal batter, filled with a flavorful spiced potato mixture. 
        The batter is prepared by soaking rice and split urad dal, then grinding them into a smooth paste and allowing it to ferment overnight. 
        This fermentation process gives the dosa its characteristic tangy flavor and crispy texture. 
        The potato filling is made by saut√©ing onions, mustard seeds, cumin, and curry leaves, then mixing in boiled potatoes, turmeric, and spices.

        Once the batter is ready, it's spread on a hot griddle, cooked until crispy, and then filled with the spiced potato mixture. 
        The dosa is typically served with coconut chutney and sambar, adding both freshness and a hint of spice. 
        This dish is a favorite for breakfast or lunch and is enjoyed for its balance of crispy texture, savory filling, and aromatic spices.
